            <p class="about">When it comes to reconnecting with nature, Rishikesh has to be on the list! Camping in
                Rishikesh on the banks of River Ganga brings not only close to nature but also has a more spiritual
                connection. The simple tents have basic facilities which provides a good break from the life in cities.
                While camping, do not miss river rafting, trekking, yoga, meditation or just sitting along the river
                banks.</p>
